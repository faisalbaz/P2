<h2>Code style divergences</h2>
list any divergences from PSR-1/PSR-2 and course guidelines on code style:
I have tried my best to follow all guidelines in these texts. However, being a Visual Studio C# developer, I use variable naming little different which could be a potential change in my code. It is not intentional to neglect PSR guidelines but I do my best to keep standards separated when programming for school or work.
